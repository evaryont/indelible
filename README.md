# ZenNote — A mindful syncing tool for SimpleNote

I'm a big fan of the [Notational Velocity][1] way of life, but use a Linux desktop most of the day. On top of that, I'm an emacs user — therefore, I wish to remain ensconsced in its arms as much as I can.

As part of my Friday Hack routine, I've taken upon writing a sync backend for SimpleNote. The idea is simple: start running, forget about it, deal with simple text files and let it do its trick. Right now it's still missing the little daemon that will keep everything working, but manual syncs go well, and I'm happy with what I have for only a few hours of work.

It's slow. Use with caution.
